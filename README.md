# COVID-19-India-Data visualization
Using the covid-19 dataset, the data analysis and visualization are performed.
The dataset used here is from the Kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india . This website updates the dataset day by day.

So the dataset I used in "COVID19 datavisualization(1) file" to visualize is the one which has been updated till May 3rd 2020 and in "kernel27f5176e64.ipynb" file is updated till May 6 2020.

You can download the dataset from the website above.

In this project, I have chose bar graph to represent the analysis since I thought it is better. You can use any technique or any kind of graph to plot the visualization.
